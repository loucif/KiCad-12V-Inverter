# 12V DC-to-AC Power Inverter (KiCad Project)

This repository contains the KiCad design files for a basic, self-oscillating DC-to-AC power inverter.

## Features

* **Input:** 12V DC (Battery/Supply)
* **Output:** High-voltage AC (Square/Modified Sine Wave)
* **Controller:** **IR2153** Self-Oscillating Half-Bridge Driver.
* **Power Stage:** Two **IRLZ24N** Power MOSFETs.
* **Step-Up:** Uses a **240V to 12V-0-12V** Center-Tapped Transformer (T1).
